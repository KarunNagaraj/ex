Problem it solves:
The existing music streaming market consists of a duoploly, dominated by two large paid platforms like YT music and Spotify. 
Our platform provides an open source, free, feature loaded alternative music streaming to the duopoly. 
The market for song uploading is also controlled by a single company Sound Cloud, our platform allows users to upload their 
own music without any paywall or issues. 
Our platform also includes a messaging feature that allows different users to communicate with each other and share their 
messages and playlists.
